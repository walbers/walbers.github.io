Hi I'm Will Albers. I'm currently going into my Junior year at the University Of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. I'm interested in computer security, artificial intelligence, systems programming, and geography.
My interests in these studies led me to create this website to show the world my different <a href="http://walbers.github.io/projects" target="blank">projects and ideas</a> relating to these interests.

I have also followed these ideas through a variety of avenues. Throughout high school I tutored students in math and computer science as well as programming for the school's robotics team. I also started a small website company (<a href="http://www.tycho.technology/" target="blank">tycho</a>) to help the small businesses in my city that could not afford the cost of a site from a large web development company.

Now while I'm in college I have joined UIUC's <a href="https://sigpwny.github.io/" target="blank">computer security club</a> as well as joining UIUC's <a href="https://acdis.illinois.edu/" target="blank">ACDIS club</a>, a club to learn, discuss, and debate about international events and politics. I have also done a few projects. I hope to continue these passions and update this site with my new projects and discoveries.

For fun I enjoy video games, listening to podcasts, running, and reading.
