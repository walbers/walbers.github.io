Hi I'm Will Albers. I'm currently going into my Junior year at the University Of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. I'm interested in computer security, artificial intelligence, systems programming, and geography.
My interests in these studies led me to create this website to show the world my different <a href="http://walbers.github.io/projects" target="blank">projects and ideas</a> relating to these interests.

I have also followed these ideas through a variety of avenues. Throughout high school I tutored students in math and computer science as well as programming for the school's robotics team. I also formed a small startup (<a href="http://www.tycho.technology/" target="blank">tycho</a>) that helps small businesses in my city that could not afford the cost of a site from a large web development company by building them a functional and high-quality website.

Here at college I have joined UIUC's <a href="https://sigpwny.github.io/" target="blank">computer security club</a> as well as joining UIUC's <a href="https://acdis.illinois.edu/" target="blank">ACDIS club</a>, a club to learn, discuss, and debate  international events and politics. This site also presents the projects I have done while at UIUC. I hope to continue these passions and update this site with my new projects and discoveries.

For fun I enjoy video games, listening to podcasts, running, and reading.
<br/>
Fun facts: I like to eat limes and my favorite animal is the octopus!
